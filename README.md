 The implemented system follows a client-server architecture, where the server side handles
 multiple client connections concurrently using threads and multi-threading. 
 
 The server, implemented in TCPServer3.py, listens for incoming connections and
 spawns a new thread for each connected client.
 
 The client, implemented in TCPClient3.py, communicates with the server to perform
 various actions.
